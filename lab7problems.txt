Lab 7 Problems: Combinatorial Logic Design 

Remember to solve these individually, working with your partner only when
you get stuck, and seeking help from the TA only when you are both stuck.
You may NOT use any calculators.  Make sure you are on your own computer,
editing your own file.

This is your assignment for the week, not just for the day, so it is
expected that you will not finish during this lab time.

---PART 1: MORE K-MAPS---

Each of the problems has the same process.
1: Identify the inputs and outputs
 - this will be given for you to make sure we all name them the same
2: Write the truth table
 - we will give you the table to fill in.  Make sure you do not
   reorder the rows.
3: Unoptimized Sum of products.  Make sure you format the answers correctly.
  - AND is not shown (place next to each other), OR is '+', and NOT is '!'
  - whitespace does not matter.
  - place your entire answer on one line
  - The order in which products occur doesn't matter

ex. B A | C
    _______
    0 0 | 0
    0 1 | 1
    1 0 | 1
    1 1 | 0

C = !BA + B!A

4: Draw K-map yourself on a piece of paper
5: Write out the minimized sum of products, using the K-map as a guide
6: Draw the circuit using the Logicly free website (https://logic.ly/demo/) and try out different inputs while observing the output.
7: Take a screenshot of the circuit from step 6. If you take a photograph instead, please make sure IT IS CLEAR and has no glare, otherwise it WILL NOT BE GRADED!
I really do recommend the screenshot instead. Call the picture files "lab7_1.jpg" and "lab7_2.jpg" (or .gif, or any other convenient picture file type).

1.) Given this truth table, do steps 2-4.
  A B C D | O
  ___________
  0 0 0 0 | 0
  0 0 0 1 | 1
  0 0 1 0 | 0
  0 0 1 1 | 0
  0 1 0 0 | 1
  0 1 0 1 | 0
  0 1 1 0 | 1
  0 1 1 1 | 0
  1 0 0 0 | 0
  1 0 0 1 | 1
  1 0 1 0 | 0
  1 0 1 1 | 0
  1 1 0 0 | 0
  1 1 0 1 | 0
  1 1 1 0 | 0
  1 1 1 1 | 0

Unoptimized Sum of Products equation
1a) O = !AB!C!D + !A!B!CD + A!B!CD + !ABC!D

Draw the K-map and simplify
Optimized Sum of Products equation
1b) O = !B!CD + !AB!D

Do steps 6 & 7 for this problem (call the image file "lab7_1.jpg" or "lab7_1.gif" or etc...).

2.) Given this truth table, do steps 2-4.
    Note the use of don't-cares, represented by `X`.
  A B C D | O
  ___________
  0 0 0 0 | 1
  0 0 0 1 | X
  0 0 1 0 | 0
  0 0 1 1 | 1
  0 1 0 0 | X
  0 1 0 1 | 0
  0 1 1 0 | X
  0 1 1 1 | 0
  1 0 0 0 | X
  1 0 0 1 | 0
  1 0 1 0 | 1
  1 0 1 1 | 0
  1 1 0 0 | 1
  1 1 0 1 | 0
  1 1 1 0 | X
  1 1 1 1 | 0

Unoptimized Sum of Products equation
2a) O = !A!B!C!D + AB!C!D + !A!BCD + A!BC!D

Draw the K-map and simplify
Optimized Sum of Products equation
2b) O = !C!D + !A!BD + A!D

Do steps 6 & 7 for this problem (call the image file "lab7_2.jpg" or "lab7_2.gif" or etc...).

---PART 2: MULTIPLEXERS---

For your answers for this part, put your answer on the SAME LINE as the
prompt.  For example:

What is 2 + 8?
ex) 10


3) The 8-input MUX can be constructed entirely with 2-input MUXes.
I will start you out - put inputs A and B into one MUX and inputs C and D
into another MUX. Continue on with E F and G H like this.
This is the first stage of the solution.
Then decide how to reconcile the two results from those MUXes.
Look hard at the logic for the 2-input MUX vs the 8-input MUX.

How many 2-input MUXes are needed to create an 8-input MUX?
3a) 7

How many select lines are needed?
3b) 3

Draw the circuit and include it in your submission as "lab7mux.jpg".
This can be a screenshot or a well-taken photo (make it easy for us to look at it and grade, or it won't be graded...)

4.) Now think of a MUX that has `2^n` inputs.  All of your answers will
have the variable `n` in them.  Please denote exponentials as base^exp,
such as n^2.

How many select bits are there?
4a)n

If it is implemented with 2-input MUXes, how many MUXes are there in
the first stage?
4b)2^(n-1)

How many 2-input MUXes are there in the second stage?
4c)2^(n-2)

How many stages of 2-input MUXes are there?
4d)n
